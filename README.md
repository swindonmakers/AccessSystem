AccessSystem - Swindon Makerspace
=================================

Overview
--------

A (semi-) automated access system for registering new members and
giving them access to the physical space. It provides a registration
form for new members to sign up, the ability to match RFID tokens to
members, and an API for the controllers (eg the Door) to verify if an
RFID token is valid (including whether the owner is uptodate with
payments).

We also include, via running RapidApp, a UI for admins to manually
edit the database, to assign tokens to members and troubleshoot
issues.

Technologies
------------

* Perl 

* Catalyst - Perl Web Framework

* RapidApp - CRUD built atop Catalyst

* DBIx::Cass - Perl ORM

* SQLite (or pretty much any database, see above)

* Template Toolkit - Perl templating (in this case for HTML)

* Daemon::Control - init.d style stuff (live system)

* JSON - API data send/receive

* SendInBlue - SMTP email sending service - free to low volume (live system)

* OneAll.com - social logins

* Barclayscrape - Pull current transactions from a Barclays bank account

* Telegram::Bot::Brain - A Mojo based module to create a Telegram bot.

INSTALL
-------

* Install Perl - see http://perl.org, mac/linux style systems will probably have it already.

* Install cpanm, either via https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus or wget http://xrl.us/cpanm, make the result executable.

* Install carton: cpanm -S Carton

* Checkout this git repo, cd into the repo directory.

* Install dependencies for this system: carton install --deployment

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Create a file *accesssystem_api.conf*, using *accesssystem_api.conf.example* as a template. This is an Apache style config file.

Main things to add/edit:

* dsn, user, password - Database connection string, see (https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI)[DBI docs] for details.
* cc - for emails, add yours here for testing emails (else they are CC'd to info@swindon-makerspace.org)
* namespace - if running this not in a / path, add the proxied path here
* OneAll - logins for the /profile etc pages, details from your oneall account

RUN
---

This respository contains two main pieces of software, the first is a thin layer over (https://metacpan.org/pod/RapidApp)[RadpiApp]. To run this, use the script:

CATALYST_HOME=$PWD carton exec perl script/accesssystem_server.pl --port 3001

Which will start a service on http://localhost:3001/admin

To run the API, use the script:

CATALYST_HOME=$PWD carton exec perl script/accesssystem_api_server.pl --port 3000

Which will start a service on http://localhost:3000/

NB: There is no index page on the API server, see below for details

Telegram bot
------------

To run the telegram bot, you will need to contact @BotFather on telegram and setup your own test bot, it will give you an API key.

The bot does not require Catalyst or RapidApp, it does require two config files:

* accesssystem_api.conf - the Model::AccessDB section
* keys.conf - create a keys.conf with the following:

    <Telegram::Bot>
        api <yourbotapikey>
    </Telegram::Bot>

Currently the bot requires a patch/branch of the Telegram::Bot::Brain code, checkout (or clone and checkout) the following repository/branch:

git clone git@github.com:castaway/Telegram-Bot.git
cd Telegram-Bot
git checkout castaway/implement_callback_queries

To run: BOT_HOME=$PWD carton exec perl -I <path to checkout>/lib script/access_telegram.pl

API/UI
------

The custom parts of the API half of the system are explained here.

### New members

The /register endpoint displays a form to collect data about new members. Included in the form is a checkbox for "add children", if checked on submit the /add_child endpoint is shown - this is the same person details form. Successive children can be added until the "more children" checkbox is not selected.

Each Person row is created as the form is submitted, each child row points back to the parent row with a parent_id.

After all new people have been added, access is added for each new person, to the Door "AccessibleThing".

Finally an email is sent to the new member containing a confirmation and their payment information, the same details are then displayed.

### Verifying members

The /verify endpoint is for access nodes/things, for example the door, to query the status of an access token that was presented to it. Given a token id, and a thing id, we first match the token to its member, then check if a) the members payments are uptodate, b) the member is allowed to access the thing.

The result is a chunk of JSON that contains the person's name, their status as a trainer of the thing, and a key "access" with 1 for yes and 0 for no.

If the result is no, a key "error" with a text message is also included.

### Storing messages

The /msg_log endpoint can be used (by any thing). Given a message and a thing id, the message is stored in the log table.

### Induction

The /induct endpoint allows a thing to store details about a member's induction to itself, by a trainer.

JSON is returned containing either "allowed":1 and the students name, or "allowed":0 and the reason in the "error" key.

### Resending member emails

The /resendemail endpoint sends the given member their confirmation/bank details email again. This is used for sending updated details after changing concessionary status etc.

JSON is returned indicating whether the given member id exists, or that an attempt was made to send an email.

### Reminding expired members

The /nudge_member endpoint is used to email a member asking if/why their payment status isn't valid.

### Membership status review

The /membership_status_update endpoint gathers data about numbers of members, paying, expired, ex, children, concessions etc that exist. The result is emailed to the Makerspace directors, and displayed as JSON.

### Logins

The /login endpoint allows members to login, currently Github and Google are supported as social login methods, more are easily added via OneAll. The member must use an account with an email address that matches their registered email address, this is how the login is mapped to a member. This stores a cookie.

The /logout endpoint removes the cookie.

The /profile endpoint displays the logged in member their details, including last known payment date. Some details link to the /editme endpoint.

The /editme endpoint displays the same form as the /register endpoint, but loads + saves the membership details for the logged in user.

Security & DPA
--------------

### Personal data

The RapidApp part of the system allows access to all the data,
including personal data. It is protected by a login system. All
default views in RapidApp are altered so that any admins using it do
not see any personal data other than names, without expressly asking
for it.

### Mis-use of /verify, /induct etc

The database stores an expected IP for each Thing controller, these
are assigned as fixed IPs to the controllers by the main network
router. The API verifies that the IP of an incoming request matches
the expected IP for the claimed thing controller id.

### Personal logins

Cookies for personal logins are hashed to guard against content
guessing (entire cookie stealing is not prevented). Members will have
access only to their own data, and some shared items such as the door
codes.

Development/operation
---------------------

### Payment management

Each member is considered valid if they have a matching payment row in
the database that covers the current date. Payment rows have an added
date and an expiry date.

Member payments are preferred to be via Standing Order, and contain a
reference built from the member's id, eg member #1 will have to send a
ref of SM0001 in their payment.

Transactions are read regularly (nightly) from barclays bank using (https://github.com/russss/barclayscrape)[barclayscrape]. Any transaction matching SM\d+ is taken to be a payment for that member. A new payment row is added - if the member is currently valid, the new row's expiry date is extended from their current expiry date. If they are invalid, the new row expires ($amount_paid / $amount_due) months from the current date. (This has to be a whole number, else the entire payment is rejected).

Payments may cover more than one month at a time. Monthly dues are calculated  starting with the standard rate (£25) and adjusting for circumstances -  if the member is a member of another hackspace the value is reduced to £5, if the member has more than one child registered, £5 is added per child, for members with concessions the value is then divided by 2.

The value paid is then divided by this calculated amount, and that number of months is added to the member's expiry date.

As of April 2018 - members may also specify the preference to pay more than their calculated amount, if the stored amount for this field is more than the calculated amount (described above), then the stored amount is used instead.

To allow for bank oddities and other mishaps, an overlap of 14 days is allowed between payments.

### Database updates

The database schema layout is maintained in the (https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class)[DBIx::Class] files, under AccessSystem/Schema/Result/*.pm (one per table). To change the database, edit these files (or add new), increment the VERSION in AccessSystem/Schema.pm then:

    perl -Ilib -Mlocal::lib=/usr/src/perl/libs/access_system/perl5/ -MAccessSystem::Schema -le 'AccessSystem::Schema->connect("dbi:SQLite:test.db")->create_ddl_dir(undef, undef, undef, "previous version number")'

This will create a set of AccessSystem-Schema-$OLDVER-$NEWVER-$DATABASE.sql. Use these to update the actual database.

Schema change: If your person table has a concessionary_rate column, then add a new person.concessionary_rate_override as a varchar.  Set it to "legacy" if concessionary_rate is true, then remove the concessionary_rate column.
