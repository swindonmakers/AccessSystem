Dear [% member.name %],

Our membership rates have recently changed. Hopefully you have seen this in recent emails, this is due to increase in rent and similar bills
While you have access to the end of your current months membership, you will need to update your standing order to the new rate for your membership to continue
Payment details are the same below just incase along with the new monthly fees rate


 
 Monthly fee: &pound;[% member.dues / 100 | format('%.2f') %]/month
 To: Swindon Makerspace CIC
 Bank: Barclays
 Sort Code: 20-84-58
 Account: 83789160
 Ref: [% member.bank_ref %]
 

Please update your membership fees, failure to do so will move you to a donor tier which does not have access to the Makerspace 
If you have already paid your old amount this month, you can pay the difference to top up, this will restore your account to your chosen tier if done within a month.

Any issues please contact us either on Telegram or email us at info@swindon-makerspace.org 
Regards,

Swindon Makerspace
