<p>Dear [% member.name %],</p>

<p>Our membership rates have recently changed. Hopefully you have seen this in recent emails, this is due to increase in rent and similar bills</p>
<p>While you have access to the end of your current months membership, you will need to update your standing order to the new rate for your membership to continue</p>
<p>Payment details are the same below just incase along with the new monthly fees rate</p>

<p>
 <ul>
  <li>Monthly fee: &pound;[% member.dues / 100 | format('%.2f') %]/month</li>
  <li>To: Swindon Makerspace CIC</li>
  <li>Bank: Barclays</li>
  <li>Sort Code: 20-84-58</li>
  <li>Account: 83789160</li>
  <li>Ref: [% member.bank_ref %]</li>
 </ul>
</p>

<p>Please update your membership fees, failure to do so will move you to a donor tier which does not have access to the Makerspace </p>
<p> If this does happen paying the difference to complete the monthly fee will reactivate your account</p>

<p>Any issues please contact us either on Telegram or email us at info@swindon-makerspace.org </p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Swindon Makerspace</p>
