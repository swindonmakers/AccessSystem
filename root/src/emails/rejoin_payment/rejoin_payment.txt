Dear [% member.name %],

Welcome back, we have recieved your membership payments and
reactivated your existing account.

Your door token will now work again and you can access the makerspace
once more.

If you have lost your door token, visit the Makerspace on a
Wednesday evening and ask to be assigned a new one. To organise a different
date email us at info@swindon-makerspace.org or (better) join our
group Telegram chat: https://t.me/+z-nkXH8Hc9E3MGJk .

If you have stopped being a member for 3+ months then you will have
lost your induction status and be required to be reinducted before
being able to use them again

If you drive to the Makerspace please don't forget that each time you visit you need to register your car in the parking lot here.

You can also use the tablets in the entrances to the building, use one of the makerspace's laptops where the link is bookmarked, or scan the QR code in the Makerspace


Regards,

Swindon Makerspace
