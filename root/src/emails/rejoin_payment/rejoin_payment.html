<p>Dear [% member.name %],</p>

<p>Welcome back, we have recieved your membership payments and reactivated your existing account. Your door token will now work again and you can access the makerspace once more.</p>

<p>If you have lost your door token, visit the Makerspace on a Wednesday evening and ask to be assigned a new one. To organise a different date email us at info@swindon-makerspace.org or (better) join our <a href='https://t.me/+z-nkXH8Hc9E3MGJk'>Telegram group</a></p>

<p>If you have stopped being a member for 3+ months then you will have lost your induction status and be required to be reinducted before being able to use them again.</p>

<p>If you drive to the Makerspace please don't forget that each time you visit you need to register your car in the parking lot <a href='www.parkinggenie.co.uk/22959'>here</a>.<br/> 
You can also use the tablets in the entrances to the building, use one of the makerspace's laptops where the link is bookmarked, or scan the QR code in the Makerspace</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Swindon Makerspace</p>
