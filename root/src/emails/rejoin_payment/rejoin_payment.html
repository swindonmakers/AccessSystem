<p>Dear [% member.name %],</p>

<p>Welcome back, we have recieved your membership payments and reactivated your existing account<br/>

Your door token will now work again and you can access the makerspace once more <br/></p>

<p>If you have lost your door token, visit the Makerspace on a<br/>
Wednesday evening and ask to be assigned a new one. To organise a different<br/>
date email us at info@swindon-makerspace.org or (better) join our<br/>
group Telegram chat: <a href='https://t.me/joinchat/A5Xbrj7rku0D-F3p8wAgtQ'>Telegram group</a> .<br/></p>

<p>If you have stopped being a member for 3+ months then you will have lost your induction status and be required to be reinducted before being able to use them again<br/></p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Swindon Makerspace</p>
