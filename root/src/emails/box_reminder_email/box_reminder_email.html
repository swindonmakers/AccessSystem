<h3>Hello, [% member.name %],</h3>

<p>We were just doing a check-up of the member boxes, and we noticed you seem to have a box, but not a current membership.</p>
<p>We would, of course, love to have you back. Now is a great time to re-up. If circumstances have changed such that you need a concessionary membership (half price, 12.50 GBP/month), reply to this email and a director will help you. </p>
<p>If you've decided to not rejoin, then please reply to this email and arrange a time to get your box or if you dont want you box at all let us know</p>

<p>if you could let us know why you are leaving it would be greatly appreciated with this short form https://forms.gle/hnaa1honuW29jEdq5</p>

<p>If you don't tell us anything, or pay your membership fees, at some point after [% now_plus_one_month %], we will assume you don't want your box & contents back.  Consider this your final warning of that.</p>

<p>Just in case you've fogotten how to give us money:</p>
