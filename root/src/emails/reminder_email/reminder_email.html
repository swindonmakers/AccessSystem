<p>Dear [% member.name %],</p>

<p>We've noticed that you haven't paid any Makerspace membership dues recently, your last payment was on [% paid_date %], and your membership has been expired since [% expires_date %]. If you intended to let your membership lapse, would you mind confirming by <a href='https://forms.gle/hnaa1honuW29jEdq5'>telling us why</a> or by replying to this email.</p>

<p>If you'd like to resume your membership, we'd love to see you! Just make another payment and your membership will resume. We will store your membership data (for reporting purposes) for a year, and then delete it from our systems. If you wish to rejoin after a year, you will need to re-register.</p>

<p>Please note: If you have left any items in the space, and intend not to resume your membership, please come and collect them. We will move items to roof storage, and in 2 weeks consider them a donation to the space.</p>

<p>This is the only reminder email we'll send you.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Swindon Makerspace</p>
