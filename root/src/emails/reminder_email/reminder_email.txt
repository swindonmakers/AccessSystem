Dear [% member.name %],

We've noticed that you haven't paid any Makerspace membership dues recently, your last payment was on [% paid_date %], and your membership has been expired since [% expires_date %]. If you intended to let your membership lapse, would you mind confirming by using this form https://forms.gle/hnaa1honuW29jEdq5 or by replying to this email.

If you'd like to resume your membership, we'd love to see you! Just make another payment and your membership will resume. We will store your membership data (for reporting purposes) for a year, and then delete it from our systems. If you wish to rejoin after a year, you will need to re-register.

Please note: If you have left any items in the space, and intend not to resume your membership, please come and collect them. We will move items to roof storage, and in 2 weeks consider them a donation to the space.

This is the only reminder email we'll send you.

Regards,

Swindon Makerspace
