# Email templates

## Considerations:

- clear email copy: short for better readability. (https://hemingwayapp.com/)
- make emails accessible
- dark and light mode compatible
- email design is on-brand: imagery, colours, logo, font, and CTA button are consistent with the website
- responsive email design: email with max 600-640px, links and CTAs are within thumb reach, leave generous
    white space around sentences, images, and CTA buttons
- footer: Unsubscribe link where it makes sense, social media links, contact us etc

### Mobile email design best practices

- Make sure the copy is legible, even when someone’s reading the message while on the go. Consider increasing the line
    spacing and font size to 14-16 px for regular text and 22 px for headlines.
- Make sure links and CTAs can be easily clicked when using a thumb. In most cases, buttons should have approximately
    44 x 44 px (minimum 29 x 44 px)
- Include extra breathing room between CTAs to make clicking easier. Add 10-20 px of extra space around clickable areas
    and avoid adding several text links next to each other.
- Consider using deep links in the emails.
- Always test and check what the email template looks like on different devices before sending it. What might look good
    on a desktop might not look the same on a mobile device.
- If the message is long, consider repeating the main CTA further down in the email to save the recipients’ scrolling time
- To ensure the subject line doesn’t lose its meaning, keep it short (30-40 characters) or ensure the most important information is placed at the beginning
