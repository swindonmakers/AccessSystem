<p>Please do make sure you have read the Member's Guide (which you just agreed to!) as this details how the space works</p>
<p>- if you missed it, here is the link again: <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ruqYeKe7kMMnNzKh_LLo2aeoFufMfQsdX987iU6zgCI/edit#heading=h.a7vgchnwk02g'>Membership Guide</a></p>

<p>For live chat with other members, you are encouraged to join our <a href='https://t.me/joinchat/A5Xbrj7rku0D-F3p8wAgtQ'>Telegram group</a>.</p>
<p>This is useful for seeing if anyone is in the space, getting help/ideas on projects etc.</p>

<p>For more drawn out discussions (that you can read back on), announcements, and projects we have a <a href='http://forum.swindon-makerspace.org/'>forum</a>.</p>

<p>Information such as Equipment documentation and ongoing project notes can be found on our <a href='https://github.com/swindonmakers/wiki/wiki/'>Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Please also keep an eye on our <a href='http://www.swindon-makerspace.org/calendar/'>calendar</a>, sometimes the space is \"booked\" (see Guide!). You may still use the space, but please be courteous and avoid using loud machinery during bookings.</p>

<p>One last thing, please do try and help out, we have a number of small and large infrastructure tasks that need doing, as well as regular maintenance (eg bins emptying!), if you see such a task and have 5 mins to do it, please don't leave it for the next member.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far! See you in the space!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Swindon Makerspace</p>
