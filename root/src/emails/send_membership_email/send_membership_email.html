<p>To get access to the Makerspace, please visit on an open evening (Wednesday evenings), and bring (or buy for £1 from the space) a suitable RFID token.</p>

<p>Please do make sure you have read the Member's Guide (which you just agreed to!) as this details how the space works</p>
<p>If you missed it, here is the link again: <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ruqYeKe7kMMnNzKh_LLo2aeoFufMfQsdX987iU6zgCI/edit#heading=h.a7vgchnwk02g'>Membership Guide</a></p>

<p>For live chat with other members, we use the <a href='https://t.me/+z-nkXH8Hc9E3MGJk'>Telegram chat</a> app, Join this group for Headline news, and links to our other chat groups.</p>
<p>This is useful for seeing if anyone is in the space, getting help/ideas on projects etc.</p>

<p>If you drive to the Makerspace please don't forget that each time you visit you need to register your car in the parking lot <a href='https://www.parkinggenie.co.uk/22959'>here</a>.</p> 
<p>You can also use the tablets in the entrances to the building, use one of the makerspace's laptops where the link is bookmarked, or scan the QR code in the Makerspace</p>

<p>Information such as equipment documentation and ongoing project notes can be found on our <a href='https://github.com/swindonmakers/wiki/wiki/'>Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Please also keep an eye on our <a href='http://www.swindon-makerspace.org/calendar/'>calendar</a>, sometimes the space is "booked" (see Guide!). You may still use the space, but please be courteous and avoid using loud machinery during bookings.</p>

<p>One last thing, please do try and help out, we have a number of small and large infrastructure tasks that need doing, as well as regular maintenance (eg bins emptying!), if you see such a task and have 5 mins to do it, please don't leave it for the next member.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this far! See you in the space!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Swindon Makerspace</p>
