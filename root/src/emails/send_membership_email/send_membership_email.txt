You can also use the tablets in the entrances to the building, use one of the makerspace's laptops where the link is bookmarked, or scan the QR code in the Makerspace

Information such as equipment documentation and ongoing project notes can be found on our wiki, located at https://github.com/swindonmakers/wiki/wiki/.

Please also keep an eye on our calendar at
http://www.swindon-makerspace.org/calendar/, sometimes the space is
"booked" (see Guide!)  you may still use the space, but please be
courteous and avoid using loud machinery during bookings.

One last thing, please do try and help out, we have a number of small
and large infrastructure tasks that need doing, as well as regular
maintenance (eg bins emptying!), if you see such a task and have 5
mins to do it, please don't leave it for the next member.

Thanks for reading this far! See you in the space!

Regards,

Swindon Makerspace
