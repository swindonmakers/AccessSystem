Dear [% member.name %],

Your initial payment has been received by the Swindon Makerspace, your
membership is now activated. You can now access the Makerspace.

If you do not yet have a door token, visit the Makerspace on a
Wednesday evening and ask to be assigned one. To organise a different
date email us at info@swindon-makerspace.org or (better) join our
group Telegram chat: https://t.me/joinchat/A5Xbrj7rku0D-F3p8wAgtQ .

Don't forget that you'll need inductions before you use some of the machines.

Regards,

Swindon Makerspace
